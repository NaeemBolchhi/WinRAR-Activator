#   WinRAR Activator

###   Activation

---

 - This script automatically creates a valid "rarreg.key" file in WinRAR's installation folder.

 - This method requires Internet at the time of activation.

 - WinRAR updates can be installed directly without having to activate again.

 - If you are facing difficulties with the one-liner, you can also use the manual solution.

###   Troubleshooting

---

   - If you were previously using a repack, please uninstall it first.
     
     - If you're unable to properly remove the older WinRAR from everywhere (including registry), try using Revo Uninstaller Pro to scan and delete file and registry remnants.

   - Make sure the latest original WinRAR setup is used for the installation.
     
     - Download WinRAR: [https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)

   - Now install WinRAR and wait for the script to finish.
   
     - If you're facing any problems, just make an issue and report.
